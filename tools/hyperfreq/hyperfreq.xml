What it does
------------

Hyperfreq is a APOBEC3-induced hypermutation analysis tool.
It is context-based, analyzing whether G -> A mutations are more likely in contexts associated with APOBEC3 hypermutation than in other contexts (APOBEC3G for instance is more likely to mutate GG -> AG than G followed by anything other than G).
While other tools take a similar approach, Hyperfreq uses Bayesian statistics, making it more sensitive, informative and flexible.

Considerations in choosing a Reference source
---------------------------------------------

As described above, each query sequence must be compared to a reference sequence.
These references should be evolutionarily close to query sequences, while not exhibiting a hypermutation pattern.
Hyperfreq comes bundled with several strategies for assigning reference sequences.

As the concerns associated with reference sequence strategies are rather involved, we refer you to the online `wiki documentation`_ for more information.

Output files
------------

This tool produces four output files.

:Hypermutation analysis: CSV file with statistical results.
:Hypermutation sites: CSV file with positions of sites and sequences within the alignment suspected of hypermutation.
:Hypermutation-positive alignment: FASTA alignment containing only sites suspected of hypermutation.
:Hypermutation-negative alignment: FASTA alignment containing only sites not suspected of hypermutation (can be used in downstream phylogenetic/sequence analyses, avoiding the influence of hypermutation on inferences)


Some details about the Hypermutation analysis output
----------------------------------------------------

:sequence: query sequence name
:hm_pos: whether the sequence is considered postive for hypermutation at the specified significance level
:call_pattern: if a sequence is found to be positive for multiple patterns, this indicates the pattern for which the hypermutation signal (as measured by the MAP value, below) was strongest
:cutoff_cdf: roughly speaking, the Bayesian equivalent of a P-value for the hypothesis that there is more G to A mutation in APOBEC associated contexts than in other contexts
:map: The Maximum A Posteriori, which can be interpreted as the best estimate of the effect size (relative probability of observing mutations in APOBEC contexts than other contexts)
:focus_pos, focus_neg, control_pos, control_neg: G &#8594; A mutation (pos) and non G &#8594; A mutation (neg; either another mutation or no mutation) counts in the focus (APOBEC-associated) and control contexts
